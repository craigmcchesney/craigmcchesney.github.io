## Using github to host a blog.

I have a blog attached to my domain hosted on Google Blogger.  It's sort of a pain to work with, so I wanted to think about a different approach.  The first thing I looked into was hosting a blog on github, since that is where I spend much of my life.  I didn't look to extensively, but found what looks like a reasonable approach described in [this article](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html).  Thank you Chad Baldwin!  It appeals to me because the content is in markdown format, which is something I'm pretty comfortable working with.  I followed the steps in the article to create the blog containing this article.

In a nutshell, here are the steps:

* create a github account if you don't have one
* open the [template listed in the article](https://github.com/chadbaldwin/simple-blog-bootstrap/generate)
* use the template to create a new repository called "craigmcchesney.github.io"
* edit _config.yml to customize
* edit the home page "index.md" file to customize
* add blog posts to the "_posts" directory, following the naming convention "yyyy-mm-dd-your-blog-post-name.md"
